'''
Count all elements in the array which appears at least K times after their first occurrence
Last Updated : 30 Mar, 2023
Given an array arr[] of N integer elements and an integer K. The task is to count all distinct arr[i] such that arr[i] appears at least K times in the index range i + 1 to n â€“ 1.

Examples: 


Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 1, 3}, K = 1 
Output: 1 
arr[0] = 1 is the only element that appears at least once in the index range [1, 3] i.e. arr[2]


Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1}, K = 2 
Output: 2
